## Features
This simulator system contains three models: Content, Base Station and Userï¼š
* Reflects the local popularity of downloadable content and user preferences

Besides, parameters are supported by real resultData sets.
* Communication model is a large-scale path-loss model.
* Base stations can work together.
* The whole simulation process is continuous in terms of time slices.
* The line chart which can be used directly in the paper can be directly generated. In addition, the simulator stores the result as a file.
* SimEdgeIntel is very scalable
